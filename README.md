## FAQs

### Why the app does not send notification when it is in background and the session is over?

For current version, Little Tomato is using Apple's and Google's own notification services, so for smart phones that use neither of them, Little Tomato might fail to send notifications.

We are working on supporting more notification services (e.g., Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, Honor, Huawei, etc.), but if you would like to receive notification in current version using one of the smart phones, please consider allowing the app to auto start and lock the app, so it won't be killed by operating system when the pomodoro session is running.

However, this issue should only exist on the smart phones that are using China mainland OS versions. Therefore, the ones that use a global OS version should still be able to receive notification.

### How to submit a bug or suggestion?

Before you create a new issue, please search the existing issue list to avoid creating a duplicated one. If the issue does already exist, feel free to give a thumb up or even a comment to it so that we know it might be a common issue.

If the issue does not exist yet, please create a new one and please name the title in following format `[BUG] Description of the bug` or `[Suggestion] Description of the suggestion`. If possible, please describe the bug in details and provide reproduce steps so that we can fix it sooner.

### How long will it take to resolve a bug or add a suggested feature?

As we are a 2-person team and only 1 of us mainly works on Little Tomato, so it depends on the complexity of the bug and availability of the maintainer, but fixing bugs will be our TOP priority to ensure a smooth and great user experience. We will try our best to resolve the bug ASAP.

For suggested features or improvements, we will carefully consider if it fits in Little Tomato and also some coming features. Our goal is to keep it simple but useful and enjoyable, so there is no guarantee a suggested feature will be added in Little Tomato, but we encourage all users to open an issue to give us suggestions if you have any so that we can know more about your needs to improve Little Tomato or even develop new apps to work better for you.
